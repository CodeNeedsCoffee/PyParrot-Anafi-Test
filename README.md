# pyparrot
Python interface for Parrot Drones

pyparrot was designed and implemented by Dr. Amy McGovern to program Parrot Mambo and Parrot Bebop 2
drones using python.  This interface was developed to teach K-20 STEM concepts
(programming, math, and more) by programming a drone to fly autonomously.
Anyone can use it who is interested in autonomous drone programming!

# Major updates and releases:
* 09/19/2018: Version 1.5.5: Added joystink demo for swing (thanks Victor804)
* 09/06/2018: Version 1.5.4: Removed wait in indoor mode for bebop 1
* 09/06/2018: Version 1.5.3: Added indoor mode for bebop 1
* 8/30/2018: Version 1.5.2: Updated camera pan_tilt for Bebop 1 (thanks Victor804)
* 8/21/2018: Version 1.5.1: fixed small fix for typo in minidrones (for swing)
* 8/18/2018: Version 1.5.0: major update to suppport parrot swing drones (thank you Victor804).  This does break a small backwards compatibility in that you need to import Mambo from Minidrone instead of Mambo.  Everything else remains the same.
* 8/9/2018: Version 1.4.31: hard-coded name for vision stream on windows
* 8/9/2018: Version 1.4.30: fixed vision bug in windows using VLC (tempfile issues) and also made fps a parameter for VLC vision
* 7/16/2018: Version 1.4.29: added bebop user sensor callback function to match mambo
* 7/15/2018: Version 1.4.28: added bebop battery state to default state variables (was in the dictionary only before)
* 7/13/2018: Version 1.4.27: updated Mambo() initialization to not require address for wifi mode and also updated groundcam demo for Mambo
* 7/12/2018: Version 1.4.26: added new Bebop commands (mostly setting max limits for the bebop)
* 7/11/2018: Version 1.4.25: fixed groundcam pictures for Mambo
* 7/8/2018: Version 1.4.24: switched tempfile to back to NamedTemporaryFile in DroneVisionGUI due to OS incompatibilities
* 7/8/2018: Version 1.4.23: switched tempfile to SpooledTemporaryFile in DroneVisionGUI to make it faster (uses memory instead of disk)
* 7/6/2018: Version 1.4.22: Added a wait in flat_trim for Bebop until it is received (optional)
* 7/5/2018: Version 1.4.21: Added max_tilt and max_altitude to the Bebop commands.
* 7/4/2018: Version 1.4.20: While move_relative is implemented, it seems to have a firmware bug so DO NOT USE.
* 7/4/2018: Version 1.4.19: Added move_relative command to the Bebop API.  For now, only dx, dy, and dradians should be used as there seems to be a bug internal to the firmware on dz.
* 6/17/2018: Version 1.4.18 Added landed button status to the Drone Vision GUI for safety in user code
* 6/16/2018: Version 1.4.17 Added flat trim to mambo also
