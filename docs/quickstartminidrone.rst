Quick Start Guide with a Minidrone
==============================

Using the pyparrot library on the Minidrone
---------------------------------------

Before running any of the sample code, you will need to connect to your drone.  If you have a Mambo FPV, I highly
recommend using the wifi connection since it sends much more information using wifi than BLE.  If you have a Mambo Code
or a Mambo Fly or Swing(neither of which has a camera), then you need to use the BLE connection.

wifi connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using the wifi (e.g. Mambo FPV), you need to connect your controlling device (laptop, computer, etc)
to the wifi for the drone.  Look for a wifi network named Mambo_number where number changes for each drone.

BLE connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not have a camera or want to use BLE for other reasons(e.g. swarm), you will first need to find the
BLE address of your Minidrone(s).  BLE permissions on linux require that this command run in sudo mode.
To run this, from the bin directory for your python installation, type:

::

    sudo findMinidrone


This will identify all BLE devices within hearing of the Pi.  The Minidrone's specific address will be printed at the end.
Save the address and use it in your connection code (discussed below).  If findMinidrone does not
report "FOUND A MAMBO!" or "FOUND A SWING!", then be sure your minidrone is turned on when you run the findMambo code and that your Pi
(or other linux box) has its BLE interface turned on.

The output should look something like this.  I removed my own BLE addresses from my network for security but I am
showing the address of the mambo that I use for all the demo scripts.

.. code-block:: console

    ~/miniconda3/bin $ sudo ./find_mambo
    Discovered device <address removed>
    Discovered device <address removed>
    Discovered device <address removed>
    Discovered device e0:14:d0:63:3d:d0
    Received new data from <address removed>
    Discovered device <address removed>
    Discovered device <address removed>
    Received new data from <address removed>
    Discovered device <address removed>
    FOUND A MAMBO!
    Device e0:14:d0:63:3d:d0 (random), RSSI=-60 dB
      Complete Local Name = Mambo_<numbers>



Quick start:  Demo Code
-----------------------

I have provided a set of `example <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/tree/master/examples>`_ scripts for both the
Mambo and the Bebop.  Note that you will need to edit the minidrone scripts to either use your own BLE address or to
ensure that use_wifi=True is set, so that it connects using wifi.
**Note that you do not need to run any of the other code in sudo mode!**  That was only for discovery.

Demo of the trick commands on the mambo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code shown below is the
`demoMamboTricks.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/examples/demoMamboTricks.py>`_.
demoMamboTricks.py will take off, demonstrate all 4 types of flips, and then land.  It is a good program to
verify that your connection to your mambo is working well.  Be sure to run it in a room large enough
to perform the flips!  The highlighted lines need to change for YOUR mambo and connection choices.

The second example program shows how to directly fly the mambo by controlling the yaw, pitch, roll, and
vertical movement parameters.  **Make sure you try this one in a large enough room!**
This code is provided in

Demo of the USB claw accessory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your mambo has the USB accessories (claw and gun), you can control them but you *MUST* be in BLE mode.
The mambo can only handle one USB accessory at a time and the camera counts as a USB accessory so you must use
the BLE connection only.  `demoMamboClaw.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/examples/demoMamboClaw.py>`_
show how to use the claw accessory. The highlighted line must be changed to the BLE address for your mambo and the use_wifi
parameter must stay at False.  In this demo program, the mambo takes off, opens and closes the claw, and lands again.

Demo of the ground-facing camera
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`demoMamboGroundcam.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/examples/demoMamboGroundcam.py>`_
show how to use the mambo's ground-facing camera.  This feature **ONLY** works in wifi mode.  It can be slow
to download the frames so do not count on this running at several frames per second.  The example code shown
below takes off, takes a picture, and then grabs a random picture from the ground facing camera set.
