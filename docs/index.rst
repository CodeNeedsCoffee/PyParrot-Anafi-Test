   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pyparrot's documentation!
====================================
pyparrot is designed to program Parrot Minidrone and Parrot Bebop (1 or 2) drones
using Python.  This interface was developed to teach kids of all ages (K-20) STEM
concepts (programming, math, and more) by having them program a drone
to fly autonomously.  Anyone can use it who is interested in
autonomous drone programming!
