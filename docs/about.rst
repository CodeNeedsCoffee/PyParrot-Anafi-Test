About pyparrot
-----------------

Pyparrot was developed by `Dr. Amy McGovern <http://www.mcgovern-fagg.org/amy/>`_ with the support of
the `University of Oklahoma <https://www.kipr.org>`_ and
the `Kiss Institute for Practical Robotics <https://www.kipr.org>`_.  The original goal was to teach children to program
using educational programs like `botball <http://www.botball.org>`_.  The pyparrot project has been adopted by groups
around the world and has been used in both K-12 settings and at the university level.
