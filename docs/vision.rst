.. title:: Using Vision on the Mambos and Bebop

.. vision:

Using Vision on the Mambos and Bebop
====================================

The vision system uses a common interface for the Mambo and the Bebop.  There are two approaches to the vision.
The first relies on ffmpeg and the second on libVLC.  Both approaches assume opencv is also installed.
Note, the reason we do not simply rely on opencv directly is that there is a known existing bug in
opencv with RTSP streams that makes them unreliable.  The behavior we reliably saw by using opencv directly was
that the stream would open, obtain between 10 and 15 frames and then stop collecting any new frames.  Since
this is not tenable for flying, we bypass opencv's direct open of the stream with two other approaches described below.

Using ffmpeg for vision
-----------------------

`ffmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org>`_ is an open-source cross-platform library that can be used to process a
wide variety of video and audio streams.  We use ffmpeg to bypass the issue with opencv by opening the video stream
in ffmpeg. The advantage of this approach is that the ffmpeg encoder can read the raw video streams (RTSP for
Mambo and RTP for Bebop) and convert it directly to a format that opencv can easily read.  We chose to convert to png
format.  The disadvantage is that ffmpeg has to save the converted images to disk, which introduces a slight delay
to the image processing.  If you use a high-end laptop with a solid state drive, this delay can be as low as
0.5 seconds.  Lower-processing speed laptops can introduce longer delays.  However, if you want access to the images
after your flight or you do not need real-time access, this is the better choice.

The vision code itself can be found in
`DroneVision.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/pyparrot/DroneVision.py>`_.
Running this code requires both the ffmpeg software and the opencv package.  This approach does NOT show a
live stream of the vision to the user but you can visualize the images using
the `VisionServer.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/pyparrot/VisionServer.py>`_.

One thing to note:  since ffmpeg requires the images to be written to a folder, it will save images to a
directory named images inside the pyparrot package.  **You will want to clean this folder out after each flight!**


Mambo ffmpeg vision demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The demo code for the mambo, `demoMamboVision.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/examples/demoMamboVision.py>`_
shown below, has the mambo take off, move upwards for a short time, flip, and then land.
While all of this flight code is running, the vision processing is running in a separate thread.

The first highlighted line:

.. code-block:: python

    testFlying = False


can be changed to True to have the mambo fly or set to False to do the vision without the mambo moving.
**One big note:  if the mambo is NOT flying, it will turn the camera into a sleep mode after several minutes
and you either need to reboot the mambo or connect and takeoff to restart the camera.**

The highlighted line with the code:


.. code-block:: python

        mamboVision.set_user_callback_function(userVision.save_pictures, user_callback_args=None)


is where the user sets the function to be called with every new vision frame.  In this demo, the images are simply
read in and saved back to a new file name.

Bebop ffmpeg vision demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The demo code for the bebop for the ffmpeg vision works nearly identically to the mambo demo except it does
not fly the bebop around.  Instead, it starts the camera and then sleeps for 30 seconds for the user to
move around or move the drone around.  This is intended as a safe demo for indoors.  It also moves
the camera around so that it is obvious the vision is recording different photos.  The code is
available at `demoBebopVision.py <https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/blob/master/examples/demoBebopVision.py>`_
and is shown below.  The highlighted line is again where the user sets the callback function of how to
process the vision frames.

Using libVLC for vision
-----------------------

Our second approach to vision relies on the libVLC library, which in turn relies on the VLC program.
`VLC <https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html>`_ is a cross-platform media player and libVLC is a python
interface to the VLC libraries.  This can be done entirely in memory (not writing out to disk as ffmpeg required),
which means that the delay is minimized.  If you have a need for the full image stream after your flight, you likely
should choose the ffmpeg approach. If you simply want to use the vision, this approach may work better for you
since you don't have the disk delay and you don't introduce the issues with the images subdirectory.
The other advantage of this approach is that you get a real-time video stream of what the drone is seeing.  However,
controlling the drone after vision has started requires setting a new parameter called user_code_to_run, as shown
below and in the highlighted line in the demo code.

.. code-block:: python

        mamboVision = DroneVisionGUI(mambo, is_bebop=False, buffer_size=200,
                                     user_code_to_run=demo_mambo_user_vision_function, user_args=(mambo, ))


**To make this approach work, you MUST install the VLC client version 3.0.1 or greater.**
Installing only libvlc is not needed (the source is included with pyparrot) and it will not work.
Installing the client installs extra software that the libvlc python library requires.

There are two example programs, one for the bebop and one for the mambo.  Both show the window opened by this
approach and the way that a user can run their own code by assigning code to the Run button.
